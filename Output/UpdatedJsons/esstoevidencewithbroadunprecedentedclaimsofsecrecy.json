intelligence activities , sources and methods ; and information concerning foreign relations and foreign activities of the United States , including confidential sources , \u201d wrote Grenell , who was appointed by President Trump on Feb. 20 .\n\u201c This information must be protected because its disclosure reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage , and in many cases exceptionally grave damage , to the national security of the United States.\n\u201d Barr said his assertion of the state secret privilege \u201c encompasses four categories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information , including information which would indicate that a particular individual or entity is or was the subject of a national security investigation .\n\u2022 Reasons for investigation and results , including information which would reveal the reasons a person or entity is or was the subject of a national security investigation and information obtained as a result of that investigation .\n\u2022 Sources and methods , including information that could tend to reveal FBI sources , methods or techniques or classified policies and procedures .\n\u2022 Foreign government information and information sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information received from a foreign government .\nSean Carter , a co-chair of the 9/11 plaintiff \u2019 s executive committee , called Barr \u2019 s assertions \u201c extraordinary and unprecedented.\n\u201d \u201c This has pretty staggering implications going forward , \u201d Carter said .\n\u201c Very broadly , it takes the view that the executive branch can declare that information falls into certain general categories , like investigative findings , and can declare that by virtue of status in those categories it can be treated as a state secret .\nIf this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside 9/11 , it is a glide path for the government to withhold almost anything.\n\u201d Along with the two public declarations , the government filed a number of \u201c classified submissions lodged for the Court \u2019 s ex parte , in camera review.\n\u201d Translation : even lawyers for the 9/11 plaintiffs can not see them .\nThose classified , nonpublic documents which ostensibly seek to justify the extreme secrecy are identified as a second declaration with attachments by Grenell , a declaration by the \u201c Central Intelligence Agency , \u201d and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s subordinates , Jill Sanborn and Brian Gilhooly , officials in the FBI \u2019 s Counterterrorism Division , and New York City Assistant U.S. Attorney Sarah Normand .\nThe 9/11 families are seeking FBI records regarding Saudi Arabia \u2019 s alleged support to the al Qaeda terrorists who used passenger jets to attack New York \u2019 s World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11 , 2001 .\nThree years ago , the court allowed the 9/11 plaintiffs to try to discover new information about Fahad al-Thumairy and Omar al-Bayoumi , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingdom of Saudi Arabia .\nThumairy and Bayoumi provided assistance to Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar , who were part of the hijacking team that plowed American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon .\nA heavily censored October 2012 FBI summary report obtained by Florida Bulldog in 2016 during Freedom of Information Act litigation revealed that as of that date \u2013 eight years after the 9/11 Commission had ended \u2013 FBI agents and prosecutors in New York were actively targeting an apparent support network in the U.S. for Hazmi and Mihdhar .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawyers for the 9/11 families tried unsuccessfully later to obtain an unredacted copy of that report .\nPresident Trump , after meeting with family members at the White House last Sept. 11 , ordered the release of one name in the report \u2013 the person identified as having \u201c tasked \u201d Thumairy and Bayoumi with aiding Hazmi and Mihdhar .\nThe name has not been made public .\nA few days later , Attorney General Barr blocked the release of any additional \u201c classified national security information \u201d in the 2012 report when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in the case .\nBoth Barr and DNI Grenell , who also serves as the U.S. ambassador to Germany , noted that their assertions of privilege were not made \u201c to conceal a violation of law , or administrative error ; to prevent embarrassment to a person , organization , or agency of the Government ; to restrain competition ; or to prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protection in the interests of national security.\n\u201d Said Grenell , \u201c I make these assertions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both authorized and unauthorized \u2013 of information regarding the events surrounding and investigations of the terrorist attacks on September 11 , 2001 .\nHowever , it remains necessary to withhold considerable details about the investigations into the attacks to protect highly sensitive intelligence information .\n\u201d", "author": "Dan Christensen", "url": "https://911truth.org/barr-grenell-block-9-11-families-access-to-evidence-with-broad-unprecedented-claims-of-secrecy/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=barr-grenell-block-9-11-families-access-to-evidence-with-broad-unprecedented-claims-of-secrecy", "published": "Mon, 27 Apr 2020 04:49:51 +0000", "published_utc": 1587977391, "collection_utc": 1587987017}
