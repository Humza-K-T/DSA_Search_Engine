Why it\u2019s the worst idea ever.", "content": "We are going through a crazy time .\nUndoubtedly the craziest time in my lifetime .\nI \u2019 ve been having long , personal conversations with my friends about everything going on , doing what we can to build each other up .\nAnd many of them expressed frustration about one thing\u2026 Ever since the quarantines started they \u2019 ve been drinking more alcohol\u2026way more than they normally do .\nWhat used to be maybe a weekly ( or monthly ) occurrence , is seriously becoming an every night of the week habit that is getting out of control .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re bored and completely stressed out \u2013 and turning to booze to make them feel better .\nI hate to be a buzzkill , but honestly , I have to say it\u2026 .\nDrinking all the time , especially during this crisis , is one of the worst things you can do right now .\nYou are relying on something that ( ironically ) is horrible for your health because you are feeling stressed out .\nThere are better ways to handle this situation .\nI know you probably don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me out .\nThose nightly \u201c Quarantinis \u201d are detrimental to your immune system .\nYou \u2019 ve heard alcohol is bad for your liver \u2013 but that \u2019 s not the only organ it \u2019 s affecting .\nDrinking too much alcohol disrupts the healthy balance of bacteria your gut .\nYou see , we all have a garden of bacteria living in our intestines ( 1 ) , which is vitally important to the health of our immune system as a whole ( 2 ) .\nThe \u201c good \u201d bacteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) .\nWhen you drink \u2013 you create an imbalance in your gut bacteria ( 6 ) \u2013 which in turn compromises your body \u2019 s ability to fight infections ( 7 ) .\nFurther down the line , this can lead to leaky gut syndrome ( 8 ) \u2013 which creates tiny little holes in our digestive system organs that leak out the good bacteria we need to stay healthy and keep our immune system strong .\nWhen you drink , certain white blood cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense against infections essentially get shut down and are only about \u00bc as effective as fighting viruses as they usually are ( 9 ) .\nIt is a major blow to your natural immune defenses .\nHeavy drinking can lead to vitamin and mineral deficiencies as well , because it impairs your body \u2019 s ability to absorb nutrients ( 10 ) .\nWithout necessary nutrients , you \u2019 re more susceptible to infections and won \u2019 t be able to heal as quickly .\nAnd if all this isn \u2019 t enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to specifically increase the risk of respiratory infections ( 11 ) , such as pneumonia and ARDS .\nKnowing what we know so far about COVID-19 and how it affects the respiratory system\u2026 do you think those nightly drinks are worth the risk ?\nIt \u2019 s not just the alcohol that \u2019 s shutting off your immune system .\nMost alcoholic drinks are filled with unhealthy ingredients that are sabotaging you .\nWhat \u2019 s in your booze ( besides booze ) ?\nEver wonder what makes Bailey \u2019 s Irish Cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tropically blue ?\nWhat makes Malibu Rum so sweet , or what gives Captain Morgan its golden hue ?\nYou may never know because ingredient labeling on beer , wine , or liquor is not required by the FDA .\nThe alcohol industry has lobbied for years against ingredient labels because they don \u2019 t want you to know what you \u2019 re drinking .\nAs a result , we know more about what \u2019 s in a bottle of Windex than we do about the world \u2019 s most popular drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 ) to tell us what \u2019 s in their beer , the two largest beer manufacturers began listing their ingredients online ( 13 ) \u2013 but there is still a lot we do not know .\nMy

could mean corn syrup , but who knows ?\nThey haven \u2019 t responded to an inquiry from my team to clarify this yet .\nLiquors don \u2019 t list ingredients , but what are you mixing them with ?\nThe decision to drink alcohol is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champagne , and tequila every now and then .\nWhen I do , I make the best choices I can .\nHaving alcohol is not a judgment call that any of us should make for others , unless excessive drinking is ruining someone \u2019 s health , family , and personal life .\nThe important thing is to be educated about alcohol , what \u2019 s in it , how much should be consumed , and whether you feel it \u2019 s something you want to have in your lifestyle .\nIf you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booze , there are healthier and more effective ways to handle your
