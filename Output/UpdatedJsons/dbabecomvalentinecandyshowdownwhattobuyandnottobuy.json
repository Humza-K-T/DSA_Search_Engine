)\n\u2026 these options are way , way better than conventional Valentine \u2019 s treats , and you can find them at natural foods grocery stores or online ( links provided below ) .\nIf you \u2019 re wondering what kind of chocolate I personally like to eat , my favorite organic chocolate brands include : Please spread the word and ask your friends and loved ones to start seeking out safer candy !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ these candy swaps , please share this post with them .\nThis Valentine \u2019 s Day , I want you to know how much you mean to me and to all of us here at Food Babe .\nWe truly love you so much for being on our team and helping us change the food system .\nWe \u2019 ve got a lot in store for you this year that we know you \u2019 re going to love .\nI can \u2019 t wait until you see what \u2019 s coming .", "author": "Food Babe", "url": "https://foodbabe.com/valentine-candy-showdown-what-to-buy-and-not-to-buy/", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 14:30:59 +0000", "published_utc": 1580844659, "collection_utc": 1586994958}
