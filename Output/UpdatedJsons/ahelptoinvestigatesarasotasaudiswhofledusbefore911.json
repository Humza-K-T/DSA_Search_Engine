Bob Graham , who co-chaired Congress \u2019 Joint Inquiry into 9/11 , was disturbed the FBI had not informed his committee about the Sarasota investigation and said it suggested the FBI had deliberately concealed the investigation because it might point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c opens the door to a new chapter of investigation as to the depth of the Saudi role in 9/11.\n\u201d Early FBI statements confirmed the existence of the investigation , but sought to dismiss its significance , saying it was \u201c determined not to be related to any threat nor connected to the 9/11 plot.\n\u201d No further explanation was provided .\nThe release of the \u201c many connections \u201d report two years later ran counter to the FBI \u2019 s public position .\nNational security was the original reason cited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s mention of the CIA a secret .\nFort Lauderdale Senior U.S. District Judge William J. Zloch , however , overruled that decision last August and ordered the FBI to disclose the information .\n\u201c This material is highly relevant to plaintiff \u2019 s request , \u201d Zloch wrote in his 95-page order .\nThe information remained secret for months while the FBI considered an appeal it finally chose not to pursue .\nWhen it finally released the redacted information , the FBI offered no explanation as to why it believed its release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upheld the FBI \u2019 s secrecy concerns following a five-year , in-camera review of more than 80,000 classified pages of 9/11 records produced by the FBI \u2019 s Tampa Field Office .\nIn his order , he \u201c assured \u201d Florida Bulldog that he \u2019 d seen no records pertaining to the FBI \u2019 s Sarasota investigation .\nThat statement immediately raised questions about what happened to numerous interview reports , financial documents , telephone and Prestancia gatehouse security records that knowledgeable sources have said agents collected during the two-year probe .\nWhy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judge ?\nThe most likely answer : they are hidden behind a little known secrecy wall \u2013 an \u201c exclusion \u201d to the Freedom of Information Act \u2013 that allows the FBI to say certain sensitive records don \u2019 t exist when in fact they do .\nWhile Judge Zloch was still reading the 80,000 pages , the secretive 9/11 Review Commission released unclassified portions of its final report , including a look at new evidence that had emerged in recent years .\nThe commission , whose three members were chosen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upheld the FBI \u2019 s contention that its Sarasota investigation found nothing suspicious .\nThe FBI told commissioners the April 2002 \u201c many connection \u201d report was \u201c poorly written and wholly unsubstantiated \u2019 \u2019 and that the agent who wrote them \u201c was unable to provide any basis for the contents of the document or explain why he wrote it as he did , \u201d according to the report .\nThe commission , also known as the Meese Commission because its senior member was Reagan-era Attorney General Ed Meese , simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly from FBI Agent Sheffield .\nThe commission also did not address Sen. Graham \u2019 s assertion that the FBI had hidden its Sarasota probe from Congress or examine FBI and Florida Department of Law Enforcement records obtained by the Bulldog detailing 2004 statements by informant Wissam Taysir Hammoud that al-Hijji had introduced him to senior al Qaeda leader Adnan El-Shukrijumah and that al-Hijji had told him Osama bin Laden was his hero .\nIn an attempt to understand the Meese Commission \u2019 s conclusions and to obtain transcripts of its proceedings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notably an Oct. 5 , 2012 FBI report mentioned in a footnote \u2013 Florida Bulldog sent another FOIA request to the FBI in April 2015 .\nWhen the FBI would not produce any records , a second lawsuit was filed in July 2016 .\nAs the case moved toward an anticipated trial 2017 trial , the FBI produced hundreds of pages of heavily redacted Meese Commission records .\nIncluded were records about how much the FBI \u2019 s personal service contracts with Meese and the other commissioners and documents in which the FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the Prestancia gatehouse records that those who disclosed the existence of the investigation said were collected and showed that Atta and other hijackers had visited the al-Hijji residence .\nThe released records also included an Oct. 5 , 2012 FBI report titled \u201c Updates and Initiatives ( as of 5 October 2012 ) .\n\u201d The report contained no information about Sarasota , yet clearly showed that despite FBI assertions that the 9/11 investigation had concluded years before , it was still active and ongoing in 2012 .\nUncensored parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained \u201c evidence \u201d that two Saudis \u2013 Fahad al-Thumairy and Omar al-Bayoumi \u2014 known to have assisted 9/11 hijackers during their time in southern California were \u201c tasked \u201d to do so by a mysterious third person whose name had been censored .\nThat new information was of immediate interest to attorneys representing 9/11 victims suing Saudi Arabia in federal court in New York .\nIn July 2017 , Miami federal Judge Cecilia Altonaga avoided a trial in Florida Bulldog \u2019 s FOIA case seeking to open up redacted Meese Commission records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment .\nThe ruling required the FBI to lift some redactions , including the names of agents working the matter , but essentially shut the case down .\nBoth Florida Bulldog and the FBI appealed .\nBut in New York , where the 9/11 victims \u2019 lawsuit , long stymied by sovereign immunity that was lifted in 2016 when Congress overwhelmingly passed \u2013 over President Obama \u2019 s veto \u2013 a law allowing their claims against Saudi Arabia to proceed in U.S. courts , new and consolidated complaints were filed in March 2017 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report as a key part of its argument , attaching it as evidence that \u201c Saudi government employees and agents who in the FBI \u2019 s own words , provided \u2018 substantial assistance \u2019 to the 9/11 hijackers.\n\u2019 \u201d The Kingdom sought to dismiss the complaint , but in 2018 a New York federal judge denied its motion while limiting discovery in the case to \u201c the alleged tortious acts \u201d in California of Thumairy and Bayoumi .\nThe ruling put the October 2012 report , and the information it contained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plaintiffs \u2019 lawyers subpoenaed the government to produce an unredacted version of the 2012 report .\nAfter the Justice Department refused , the plaintiffs asked the court to compel its release .\nLast September , after meeting with 9/11 survivors and family members , President Trump instructed Attorney General William Barr to declassify the name of the third person who had \u201c tasked \u201d Thumairy and Bayoumi with helping the hijackers .\nThe name was given to the 9/11 attorneys with instructions that they could not to share it with anyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the name of Musaed al-Jarrah became public when the FBI inadvertently released it in court papers .\nJarrah is a former Saudi Foreign Ministry official who worked at the Saudi embassy in Washington in 1999-2000.s The rest of the 2012 FBI report remains classified because Barr invoked the \u201c state secrets privilege \u201d to hide it , telling the court that disclosure \u201c would risk significant harm to national security.\n\u201d In April , using legal arguments that were themselves secret , Barr invoked \u201c state secrets \u201d again more broadly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtaining other crucial evidence in support their multi-billion dollar lawsuit that seeks to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for the four coordinated al Qaeda attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 that employed hijacked passenger jets to kill 2,977 people and injure 25,000 others .\nToday , the 2012 report remains a central focus of the New York case as plaintiffs \u2019 attorneys push back on the government \u2019 s secrecy decisions .\nOn Thursday , the attorneys are expected to file a reply opposing Barr \u2019 s state secrets claims .\nThe public won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either because the court has approved a sweeping FBI \u201c protective order \u201d that is shielding from public view virtually everything about the matter .\nMeanwhile , a split federal appeals court in Atlanta last September came down largely on the side of the FBI , overturning Judge Altonaga in a ruling that held the privacy of suspects , witnesses and FBI agents involved in the 9/11 investigation outweighs the public interest in knowing their names .\nThe court also deferred to the FBI \u2019 s decisions to withhold other information , declining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2020 , The New York Times Magazine published a lengthy story , \u201c The Saudi Connection : Inside the 9/11 Case.\n\u201d The story was built around disclosures in the 2012 FBI report and interviews with former agents that explained how a team of investigators in a divided FBI had kept working the 9/11 case as a \u201c subfile \u201d under the code name \u201c Operation Encore.\n\u201d The subfile probe was essentially shut down in 2016 .\n\u201c The Encore investigation exposed a bitter rift within the bureau over the Saudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A senior FBI analyst prepared a \u201c forceful summary \u201d of Encore \u2019 s findings , \u201c laying out in 16 pages everything the team found about suspected Saudi complicity in the plot , \u201d the Times reported .\n\u201c He then uploaded the secret document into the FBI \u2019 s electronic record , ensuring that it could not be erased.\n\u201d Those 16 pages remain hidden today \u2013 covered up by Attorney General Barr \u2019 s assertion that it and numerous other FBI records about 9/11 are state secrets of the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens .\n\u2022 U.S. judge asked to okay
