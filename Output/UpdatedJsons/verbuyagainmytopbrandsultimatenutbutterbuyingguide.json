& Almond Butter To Never Buy Again + My Top Brands (Ultimate Nut Butter Buying Guide)", "content": "One of my favorite indulgences is almond butter .\nI eat it almost every day\u2026 I \u2019 ll put a scoop in my morning oats , in my smoothies , and spread it on celery .\nWhen I was growing up , we always had a jar of Peter Pan Peanut Butter in the house .\nTo me , that sweet heavily-processed spread was the only real peanut butter there was \u2013 and I really didn \u2019 t realize until well into my 20 \u2019 s that there are MUCH healthier options out there .\nToday , the nut butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections in the grocery store .\nYou \u2019 ve got creamy , crunchy , no-stir , stir , reduced fat , sweetened , unsweetened , palm oil , no palm oil , raw , roasted , natural , and organic .\nIt \u2019 s no wonder that one of most popular questions I get is what brand of nut butter I use .\nIn this post , I \u2019 m going to walk you through practically every brand of nut butter that you \u2019 ll see on the shelf and tell you what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute first thing I look at is the ingredient list .\nNut butter should only contain nuts ( and perhaps sea salt ) .\nFlip over all the major brands of nut butter and read the ingredients .\nIt \u2019 s common to find hydrogenated oils ( soybean and cottonseed ) or palm oil added , which is used to keep it from separating on the shelf and keeps it fresh without refrigeration .\nThis may be more convenient , but those heavily processed and refined oils are not good for your health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find sugar added to nut butter , which is an ingredient that most people eat way too much of .\nIf you are eating nut butter on a regular basis , you especially want to make sure it is not sweetened .\nOccasionally , I may choose an organic nut butter that \u2019 s sweetened with coconut sugar ( such as JEM brand ) , but I would treat this as a dessert .\nMy everyday nut butter doesn \u2019 t contain any added sugars \u2013 just nuts !\nLet me give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of peanut butter ( regular , Simply , and Natural ) that all contain white sugar and additional oils .\nOther popular brands such as Skippy , Peter Pan , and Reese \u2019 s are also filled with hydrogenated oils and white sugar .\nBarney Butter , Justin \u2019 s , and Jif Almond Butter may sound healthier , but they also add oils to their nut butters so that stirring isn \u2019 t required .\nThe oil in nuts naturally separate in the jar and float to the top , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time you use it .\nThis can be messy , but one trick I \u2019 ve found is to store an unopened jar upside down in your pantry .\nWhen you \u2019 re ready to open and use it , it is much easier to stir without making a mess because the oil has largely incorporated into the butter and settled at the bottom of the jar , instead of the top .\nAfter stirring , make sure to store the opened jar in your fridge .\nLook for Nut butters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t let the \u201c natural \u201d label guide you Some brands ( Adams , Smucker \u2019 s , Crazy Richards , Trader Joe \u2019 s , and Kirkland ) make nut butters with only nuts , but they are not certified organic .\nIt \u2019 s very important to choose organic nut butter because conventional nuts and peanuts are known to be heavily treated with synthetic pesticides and fungicides .\nEspecially when it comes to peanuts because they are a legume ( not technically a nut ) and their pods grow underground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed and concentrated .\nCouple that with the fact that peanuts are often rotated with cottonseed crops ( 1 ) ( the world \u2019 s most pesticide-ridden crop ) and you \u2019 ve got a breeding ground for massive pesticide contamination .\n( 2 ) Conventional almonds and peanuts can be contaminated with Piperonyl Butoxide ( 3 ) a pesticide ingredient that is classified by the EPA as a possible human carcinogen ( 4 ) and linked to liver damage .\nConventional almonds can also be contaminated with Chlorpyrifos ( 5 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n( 6 ) Glyphosate ( Roundup ) herbicide is used on conventional peanuts and nuts ( 7 ) \u2013 and it \u2019 s known to cause cancer ( 8 ) .\nProducts are usually not tested for these chemicals , but residues of glyphosate have been found in Skippy Natural Peanut Butter .\n( 9 ) The best nut butters are both Raw & Organic .\nThere are several organic brands with one ingredient ( which is good ) , but they are made with roasted nuts instead of raw nuts .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nuts are \u201c Raw \u201d on the label , it is safe to assume the nuts are roasted .\nRoasted nut butters taste really good , I \u2019 m not going to lie \u2013 but if you want to choose the best one , raw nuts are healthiest because\u2026 \u2022 Roasting can damage the healthy fats that are found in nuts .\nOne of the greatest health benefits of nuts are the healthy polyunsaturated fats they contain , so you don \u2019 t want those destroyed !\nWhen nuts are roasted at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these fats can oxidize , a process that generates free radicals .\n( 10 ) .\nFree radicals are renegade molecules that damage cells in the body .\n\u2022 Oftentimes , \u201c roasted nuts \u201d are not actually roasted but fried in oils .\nThese oils end up in the finished product .\n\u2022 Roasted nuts may contain fewer antioxidants and nutrients like vitamin E which are prevalent in almonds .\n\u2022 Roasting at high temperatures may produce harmful substances like acrylamide , which is linked to cancer .\nWhen it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more tricky .\nRaw peanuts may be contaminated with Aspergillus flavus , a type of mold which produces the cancerous toxin aflatoxin .\n( 11 ) Roasting peanuts prohibits the production of aflatoxin and may also reduce aflatoxin content ( 12 ) \u2013 so roasting may make peanuts safer to eat .\nAlso , the fat found in peanuts is fairly heat resistant and less likely to oxidize .\n( 13 ) It \u2019 s rare to find raw peanut butter on the market , but you can make it at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. are pasteurized ( typically with steam if they are organic ) to destroy any pathogens such as salmonella .\nSo there are not any truly raw U.S. almonds , but they are not cooked to the extent of roasted almonds .\nBeware that if the almonds are NOT organic , they may be pasteurized with the toxic chemical propylene oxide \u2013 which is classified as a probable human carcinogen .\n( 14 ) Yet another reason to only choose organic !\nThree steps to finding the healthiest nut butter : \u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt ) \u2022 Is certified organic .\nLook for the USDA organic seal on the label .\n\u2022 The nuts and seeds are raw ( not roasted ) , with the exception of peanut butter .\nIt will say specifically on the jar that it is \u201c raw \u201d .\nSome brands make conventional and raw organic versions , so you need to be very careful when shopping .\nFor example , the brand MaraNatha makes conventional almond butters , but also has a raw organic version that I like .\nThe packaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading the ingredient list is so important .\nMy picks for the best nut butters & seed butters : To make it super easy for you , here \u2019 s a list of brands that meet my criteria .\nI personally buy the Artisana Organics brand often \u2013 which is found in natural grocery stores and online .\nIf you have a nut allergy , I also listed my picks for seed butters .\nThis includes pumpkin seed butter , which many people find better tasting than sunflower seed butter .\nWant more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list
