the Kellogg\u2019s shareholders meeting and what the CEO said will shock you (VIDEO)", "content": "I have some outrageous news for you today\u2026 If you \u2019 ve been reading this blog \u2013 you know that Kellogg \u2019 s sells cereals in the U.S. with artificial colors , artificial flavors , and BHT , while they make the same cereals without these risky ingredients in other countries .\nWe petitioned Kellogg \u2019 s , asking them to remove artificial ingredients from all of their cereals in the U.S. just as they do in other countries .\nThis petition has now reached over 50,000 signatures of concerned citizens ( add your name now ) .\nKellogg \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , due to COVID-19 travel restrictions , I was unable to go in person to the Kellogg \u2019 s annual shareholder meeting to deliver these petitions .\nSo I had to come up with another plan\u2026 I was authorized by a Kellogg \u2019 s shareholder to act as their representative at Kellogg \u2019 s virtual meeting last week .\nI was only permitted to submit written questions , and there was the risk that the moderator would ignore my questions .\nOnly one of my questions was read and answered during the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented at the meeting : During your 2015 2nd Quarter Earnings Call , Paul Norman , former president of Kellogg North America stated : \u201c we have been working to remove artificial colors and flavors across Kellogg \u2019 s branded cereals and a variety of Kellogg \u2019 s branded snack bars as well as Eggo frozen foods .\nOur goal is to complete this transition by the end of 2018.\n\u201d Kellogg \u2019 s currently is still selling cereal made with artificial colors , such as Fruit Loops and Apple Jacks .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some limited-edition cereals , such as Baby Shark Cereal .\nWhat is Kellogg \u2019 s current position on this ?\nDoes Kellogg \u2019 s still have a goal to remove artificial colors and artificial flavors from their entire line of cereal ?\nThis question was ignored .\nI then asked a 2nd question regarding the status of removing BHT from all of their cereals .\nThis question was also ignored .\nFinally , my 3rd question was read during the meeting .\nYou can listen to the video below to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current position on removing artificial colors from all your cereals , such as Fruit Loops and Apple Jacks ?\nSteven Cahillane , CEO of Kellogg \u2019 s : \u201c We have made tremendous progress in removing artificial ingredients from all of our products including our ready-to-eat cereal products .\nWhere we will not make compromise is around taste and enjoyment , and so , to the extent that we can continue to make progress and delight consumers with non-compromising foods , that \u2019 s our north star.\n\u201d They are liars .\nDid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial ingredients from their cereals ?\nIn 2015 this was all over the news\u2026 I \u2019 m sure they loved all the good publicity !\nWell , now everyone can know that they are LIARS .\nKellogg \u2019 s is sacrificing health to \u201c delight consumers \u201d .\nWhat ?\nIs this really true ?\nThe truth is that Kellogg \u2019 s is not making \u201c tremendous progress \u201d removing artificial ingredients from their cereals , and continues to create brand new cereals FOR CHILDREN with them .\nAll the while , Kellogg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients in other countries .\nWe \u2019 re not asking Kellogg \u2019 s to start at square one and to reformulate their cereals without artificial ingredients , as this has already been done !\nAdd your name to the petition asking Kellogg \u2019 s to stop using artificial ingredients in America : SIGN NOW I \u2019 m confident that Kellogg \u2019 s will change , but it will take all of us .\nJust like when we petitioned Kraft and I arrived uninvited at their headquarters with thousands of your signatures , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , I \u2019 ll never forget what they told me\u2026 Kraft said , \u201c We \u2019 ll have to agree to disagree \u201d and that their customers like Kraft Mac & Cheese just the way it was , with artificial colors .\nWell , we all know what happened next !\nKraft removed the artificial colors after all .\nWe influenced Kraft to change their iconic Mac & Cheese and I know in my heart that we can influence Kellogg \u2019 s to do the same with Fruit Loops , Apple Jacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I \u2019 m so thankful to all of you who have stepped up in such a huge way in support for this petition .\nYou \u2019 re truly remarkable .\nMake sure that your best friend , spouse , mom , dad , son , daughter , brother , sister , and neighbor have all signed this petition .\nWe can do this , but we all need to continue sharing our petition everywhere !\nGo , Food Babe Army , Go !\nP.S .\nIf this makes you mad , please share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNo one will hold these toxic food companies accountable other than ordinary citizens like us !", "author": "Food Babe", "url":
